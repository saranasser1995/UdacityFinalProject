# Memory Game Project

## Idea Of the game 
1- Cards you need to match are two at a time,  The game ends when all cards are opens to you 
2- When you open the cards try to save thier locations to match it faster and then get more stars
3- Number of starts you get it will be depending on how many time you try to match the cards
4- More moves or tryies mean less stars or rating 
5- Try to solve it in fast time also in few number of tries

** GOOD LUCK **

### Rating 
14 moves and less = 3 stars   
19 moves and leaa = 2 stars  
20 moves and less = 1 star 

thats mean more moves lead to decrease your rating in the game 

## Explantions
the project provided by udasity, it will be fixed so ,you will make changes on HTML+CSS pages but you need to 
be more foucs on JAVASCRIPT file to make the game more intractive or responsive to the users 

To get started, open 'js/app.js' and start building out the app's starting by 'shuffel function' by Udacity
instructions are provieded to us from UDACITY.
